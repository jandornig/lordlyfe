# Next Step Workflow

   - Before executing any task, check the `nextStep.md` document (create it if it doesnt exist) to ensure alignment with the current goals.
   - Skip this check if the task is focused on bug fixing.

2. **Update NextStep Document if Needed:**
   - If the current state or requirements change, update the `nextStep.md` document to reflect the new priorities.

   - Proceed with the execution of the task as outlined in the `nextStep.md` document.

4. **Update NextStep Document After Execution:**
   - After completing the task, update the `nextStep.md` document to reflect the progress and outline the next immediate steps. If a larger process was completed. Ensure the roadmap document is also updated.

5. **Repeat the Process:**

   - Continuously follow this workflow to ensure clarity and alignment throughout the project lifecycle.
