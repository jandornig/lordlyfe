# Phase 1: Basic Multiplayer Foundation

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core multiplayer infrastructure, enabling multiple players to connect, join rooms, and see synchronized game states. This phase is crucial as it forms the foundation for all subsequent multiplayer features.

## 1. Player Identification & Session Management ✅

### 1.1 Player ID System ✅
- [x] **Server: Implement Server-Generated Player IDs**
  - [x] On client connection or join/play request, server generates a unique `playerId`
  - [x] Server maintains a mapping between `socket.id` and `playerId`
  - [x] Server replies to the client, sending the assigned `playerId`
- [x] **Client: Adopt Server-Generated Player ID**
  - [x] Remove client-side `playerId` generation
  - [x] Client stores its server-assigned `playerId`
- [x] Add player metadata
  - [x] Player name/display name
  - [x] Connection timestamp
  - [x] Last activity timestamp

### 1.2 Session Management ✅
- [x] Implement session tracking
  - [x] Create session storage system
  - [x] Add session timeout handling
  - [x] Implement session cleanup
- [x] Add connection state management
  - [x] Track connected/disconnected states
  - [x] Handle connection events
  - [x] Implement basic error handling

## 2. Matchmaking System ✅

### 2.1 Matchmaking Queue Implementation ✅
- [x] Implement matchmaking queue data structure
  - [x] Queue ID generation
  - [x] Queue metadata
  - [x] Player capacity limits
- [x] Add queue management
  - [x] Add player to queue
  - [x] Remove player from queue
  - [x] Handle queue full conditions
- [x] **Server: Implement Match Rooms**
  - [x] Generate unique `matchId`
  - [x] Add player sockets to match room
  - [x] Handle room cleanup

### 2.2 Game Start Logic ✅
- [x] Implement game start logic
  - [x] Check queue player count
  - [x] Start game when queue is full
  - [x] Handle game initialization
- [x] Add game start events
  - [x] Notify players when game starts
  - [x] Update game state
- [x] **Server: Broadcast Game State to Match Room**
  - [x] Emit game-specific state updates to match room
  - [x] Handle game state synchronization

### 2.3 Multiplayer Game Logic Modifications ✅
- [x] **Architecture: Implement Authoritative Server Model**
  - [x] Clients send intent-based messages
  - [x] Server validates all client intents
  - [x] Server updates authoritative game state
  - [x] Clients render received game state
- [x] **Client: Implement Player Role Detection**
  - [x] Store `myPlayerId`
  - [x] Determine client's role
  - [x] Expose role via React context
- [x] Update game initialization
  - [x] Support two players
  - [x] Remove AI player
  - [x] Add second player lord placement
