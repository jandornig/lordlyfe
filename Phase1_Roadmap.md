# Phase 1: Basic Multiplayer Foundation

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core multiplayer infrastructure, enabling multiple players to connect, join rooms, and see synchronized game states. This phase is crucial as it forms the foundation for all subsequent multiplayer features.

## 1. Player Identification & Session Management

### 1.1 Player ID System
- [x] Create unique player ID generation
  - Implement UUID v4 for player identification
  - Add player ID to socket connection
  - Store player ID in game state
- [x] Add player metadata
  - Player name/display name
  - Connection timestamp
  - Last activity timestamp
- [x] UI Changes Required:
  - Add player name input field to game start page
    - Make it required before game start
    - Add validation (min/max length, allowed characters)
    - Show error messages for invalid input
  - Display player name in game UI
  - Add connection status indicator
  - Show player list in game (if multiple players)
  - Add basic player info tooltip/hover state
- [x] Testing:
  - Verify unique ID generation
  - Confirm ID persistence across reconnects
  - Test ID collision handling
  - Test UI responsiveness to connection changes
  - Verify player name display and updates
  - Test name validation and error messages

### 1.2 Session Management
- [x] Implement session tracking
  - Create session storage system
  - Add session timeout handling
  - Implement session cleanup
- [x] Add connection state management
  - Track connected/disconnected states
  - Handle connection events
  - Implement basic error handling
- [x] Testing:
  - Verify session creation/deletion
  - Test timeout handling
  - Confirm cleanup of abandoned sessions

  - Verify game start logic
  - Test game initialization
  - Confirm player notifications

### 2.3 Multiplayer Game Logic Modifications
- [ ] Update game initialization
  - Modify createNewGame to support two players
  - Remove AI player initialization
  - Add second player lord tile placement
  - Update territory distribution for two players
- [ ] Update game state management
  - Modify GameState to track both players
  - Update player turn handling

  - Test state validation
  - Confirm state recovery

### 3.2 State Broadcasting
- [ ] Implement state update system
  - Add state change detection
  - Create state update messages
  - Implement broadcast logic
- [ ] Add state synchronization
  - Handle state updates
  - Implement state reconciliation
  - Add state compression
- [ ] Testing:
  - Verify state updates
  - Test synchronization
  - Confirm state consistency

### 3.3 Player-Specific State
- [ ] Add player state tracking
  - Track player actions
  - Store player preferences
  - Handle player-specific data
- [ ] Implement state isolation
  - Separate player states
  - Handle state conflicts
  - Add state merging
- [ ] Testing:
  - Verify player state tracking
  - Test state isolation
  - Confirm state merging

## Testing Milestones

### Milestone 1: Player System
- Multiple players can connect to the server
- Each player has a unique identifier
- Sessions are properly tracked and managed
- Connection/disconnection is handled gracefully

### Milestone 2: Room System
- Players can create and join rooms
- Room state is properly maintained
- Players can leave rooms
- Room cleanup works correctly

### Milestone 3: State Synchronization
- All players in a room see the same game state
- State updates are properly broadcast
- Player-specific states are maintained
- State conflicts are resolved correctly

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
