# Gameplay Rules & Fixes

## Victory Conditions
- A player is considered defeated only when they do not own any lord tiles
- When a player captures an enemy lord tile(except the starting lord tile), all tiles in that territory that belonged to the defeated player are transferred to the capturing player

## Territory Control
- Each territory has a lord tile that serves as its control point
- Capturing a lord tile transfers ownership of all tiles in that territory currently under control of the defeated player to the capturing player. Tiles in that territory that in that moment belong to other players are not affected. 
- This includes both army units and territory control

## Game Balance
These rules ensure that:
1. Players must protect their lord tiles to stay in the game
2. Capturing enemy territory is more strategic as it provides a significant advantage
3. The game encourages aggressive play to capture enemy lords
4. Territory control is more meaningful as it can be completely transferred
