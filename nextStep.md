# Next Steps

## Critical Multiplayer Features

### 1. State Synchronization (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement state versioning
  - [ ] Add version numbers to state updates
  - [ ] Add version checking on client
  - [ ] Add version mismatch handling
- [ ] Add state reconciliation
  - [ ] Add client state validation
  - [ ] Add state recovery mechanism
- [ ] Add state compression
  - [ ] Implement delta compression
  - [ ] Add tile change tracking
  - [ ] Add unit change tracking

### 2. State Isolation (High Priority)
- [ ] Enhance player state separation
  - [ ] Implement strict state boundaries
  - [ ] Add state validation per player
  - [ ] Add state cleanup on player disconnect
- [ ] Add conflict resolution
  - [ ] Handle simultaneous actions
  - [ ] Add action validation per tick
  - [ ] Implement action queuing
- [ ] Add state merging
  - [ ] Handle player reconnections
  - [ ] Add state recovery
  - [ ] Add conflict resolution for reconnects

### 3. Core Testing (High Priority)
- [ ] Complete synchronization testing
  - [ ] Test state versioning
  - [ ] Test state reconciliation
  - [ ] Test state compression
- [ ] Test state isolation
  - [ ] Test player state separation
  - [ ] Test conflict resolution
  - [ ] Test state merging
- [ ] Test edge cases
  - [ ] Test disconnections
  - [ ] Test reconnections
  - [ ] Test simultaneous actions

## Implementation Order
1. State versioning (foundation for other features)
2. State reconciliation (ensures consistency)
3. State compression (improves performance)
4. State isolation (prevents conflicts)
5. Core testing (ensures reliability)

## Notes
- Focus on essential multiplayer features only
- Quality of life features are tracked in quality_of_life_features.md
- Each feature should be tested before moving to the next
- Document any issues or edge cases discovered during implementation
