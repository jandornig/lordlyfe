# Next Steps

## Critical Multiplayer Features

### 1. State Synchronization (High Priority)
- [x] Implement state versioning
  - [x] Add version numbers to state updates
  - [x] Add version checking on client
  - [x] Add version mismatch handling
  - [x] Add version incrementing in VersionManager
  - [x] Add version tracking in GameContext
  - [x] Add timestamp tracking for state updates
- [x] Add state reconciliation
  - [x] Add client state validation
  - [x] Add state recovery mechanism
  - [x] Add state rollback capability
  - [x] Add state verification per tick
  - [x] Add lord tile validation
  - [x] Add game state structure validation
- [ ] Add state compression
  - [ ] Implement delta compression
  - [ ] Add tile change tracking
  - [ ] Add unit change tracking

### 2. State Isolation (High Priority)
- [ ] Enhance player state separation
  - [ ] Implement strict state boundaries
  - [ ] Add state validation per player
  - [ ] Add state cleanup on player disconnect
- [ ] Add conflict resolution
  - [ ] Handle simultaneous actions
  - [ ] Add action validation per tick
  - [ ] Implement action queuing
- [ ] Add state merging
  - [ ] Handle player reconnections
  - [ ] Add state recovery
  - [ ] Add conflict resolution for reconnects

### 3. Core Testing (High Priority)
- [ ] Complete synchronization testing
  - [x] Test state versioning
  - [x] Test state reconciliation
  - [ ] Test state compression
- [ ] Test state isolation
  - [ ] Test player state separation
  - [ ] Test conflict resolution
  - [ ] Test state merging
- [ ] Test edge cases
  - [ ] Test disconnections
  - [ ] Test reconnections
  - [ ] Test simultaneous actions

## Implementation Order
1. ✅ State versioning (foundation for other features)
2. ✅ State reconciliation (ensures consistency)
3. State compression (improves performance)
4. State isolation (prevents conflicts)
5. Core testing (ensures reliability)

## Notes
- Focus on essential multiplayer features only
- Quality of life features are tracked in quality_of_life_features.md
- Each feature should be tested before moving to the next
- Document any issues or edge cases discovered during implementation

## Recent Changes
- Implemented state versioning with VersionManager
- Added version tracking in GameContext
- Added timestamp tracking for state updates
- Added version mismatch detection and handling
- Implemented state reconciliation system
- Added lord tile validation for initial game state
- Added game state structure validation
- Removed verbose logging after successful implementation
